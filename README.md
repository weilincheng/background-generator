# Linear Gradient Background Generator

This is my first project on GitHub. This background generator allow you to pick two colors and visualize the linear gradient of two picked colors on page's background. If you don't know which color to choose, you can just click the "Pick random colors!" button to pick two colors randomly.  

Hope you enjoy it!
